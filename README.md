## Introduction
#### The Pet Nanny is an application which is directed towards owners of pets. They can download this android application to maintain the information of their pet. It is meant to be an easy platform for use by pet owners to store all information that might be necessary for their pwt's wellbeing. To ensure this, the app has four main sections. It has a Profile, Calendar, Health  and an About section.

## Profile
#### The Profile section is used by pet owners to input their pet's information. They can upload a picture of their pet, their pet's name, age, birthday, breed etc. They can also add their own names as owners of their pet. 

## Calendar
#### The Calendar section makes use of the Google Calendar API, hence providing users with direct access from the application to Google Calendar.  

## Health
#### The Health section gives pet owners the opportunity to add information critical to the health of their pet. They can add medical history, shots that have already been given, shots that are pending, vet information, and groomer information. 

## About
#### This section is critical to ensuring that users have a stress free time using the application. They can view what the application is, and get tips on how to view it. Furthermore, they can read through Frequently Asked Questions by fellow users, in case they have any questions about the application's functionality.
